# BLErduino

> The Car. Operated with Arduino. Controlled with iPhone via Bluetooth LE.

Project contains an **iOS app** (Swift), Arduino **.ino** -file and Fritzing **wiring** scetch.

My christmas project.
The goal was to test my Arduino components, try something new with iOS and build something **amazing**.
